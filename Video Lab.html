<h1>Look at these Birds </h1>

<p>I used to have this huge tree in my backyard. <br/>
I did not like that tree because it would stink up the place when it grew berries. <br/>
The tree was big, so big it broke under its own weight, nice.   <br/>
What wasn't nice was that all the birds in my area had stopped coming to my yard. <br/>
I dedicate this page to some of the birds I rarely see now because that tree is no longer here. <br/>
</p>

<h2> This is a Mourning Dove</h2>

<p> This species of birds are interesting. They are related to street pigeons, I call those sky rats. <br/>
Mourning doves however are more interesting in my opinion because they have a very distint coo. <br/>
You can hear it in the video. 
</p>

<h3>This here is a Northern Red Cardinal</h3>

<p>
As you can see they are very red. Male cardinals are vibrant red while the females tends to be more brown. <br/>
The best part about these birds is that they can make a pew pew noise, much like a cheap laser gun. <br/>
You can hear the laser gun part at around 0:14 seconds of the video.

<h4>The Monk Parakeet</h4>

<p>Most people are pleasently surprised when they see one of these perched around a tree or a powerline. <br/>
They are even more surprised when they realize monk parakeets tend to come in large groups of 20 or more. <br/>
A group of them together are called a company or a pandemonium. You can guess why. <br/>
Not much to them besides the fact they are parakeets so they can learn phrases and are bright green. <br/>
</p>

<p> These are only a small portion of some of the birds I see in my yard and the fact they are no longer around makes it kind of lonely. <br/>
Well, at least that tree is no longer here to stink up the place.
